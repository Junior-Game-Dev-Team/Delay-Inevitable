## Minimum Viable Product

### Gameplay 
- This game will involve 3 stages and will take place in the same basic hallway environment
- The main character will wake up in his bedroom, where he sees the demon hanging over him for a few seconds, before disappearing out the door. The main character will follow the demon out the door, and enter the main hallways environment (the door will shut behind the player, so they will only be able to move forwards).
- As the player progresses through the hallway, the environment will become darker and more sinister. 
- Each stage of the game will be denoted by the player encountering 2-3 objects/items (these can give the player power-ups or just be collectibles that help the player fight the demon at the end of each stage) and the demon appearing for a fight. After the player successfully fights off the demon, they can continue down the hallway, entering the next stage.
- At the end of the final stage (stage 3), the player will fight the demon one last time. At this point, the player will understand narratively that the demon is someone that the main character knows.
- Here, the player can make the choice to fight and defeat the demon one last time, or try to make peace with the demon and release it from this world into the next â€“ think Undertale mechanics, the ability for the player to choose to fight or show mercy.
